Quaint
======

[Visit the site!][q]

Quaint is a markup language loosely inspired from Markdown but focused
on *consistency* and *extensibility*. It is simple and intuitive
enough to be used by non-techies, but powerful enough for hackers to
tailor to their own individual needs.

Quaint's file extension is `.q`. This README is in Markdown only
because GitHub recognizes the format. The [site][q] is entirely
written in Quaint, so click on that link!
