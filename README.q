Quaint
======

Quaint is a markup language loosely inspired from Markdown but focused
on _consistency and _extensibility. It is simple and intuitive enough
to be used by non-techies, but powerful enough for hackers to tailor
to their own individual needs.

* __Terse: Quaint does not get in your way. There is no boilerplate,
  no spurious markup. If you do something _[a lot], you can make it as
  short as you want. (Link to Wikipedia a lot? Four lines of Python
  will let you write `[/Batman] to link to Batman's Wikipedia
  article).

* __Complete: all essential functionality (links, bullet points, etc.)
  is already built-in, plus a few _very useful extras (code
  highlighting using Pygments, tables).

* __[Embedded code]: you can embed Python code in a Quaint file (use
  the extension `.py.q). For instance, you can procedurally generate
  lists or tables, write and test new extensions in a single file,
  etc. That can come in handy to generate documentation!

* __Consistent: all markup operators follow the same rules with
  respect to priority, grouping, nesting, and so on. There is no mess
  of regular expressions, no unnecessary idiosyncracies. Custom
  operators and extensions are all used like the usual ones, so you
  only ever need to learn what they _do.

* __[Easy to extend]: create a function with the proper signature,
  associate it to any valid operator you like, and you're done. If
  what you want to do is trivial (e.g. add a superscript operator),
  its implementation will be trivial (a single line of code).

Quaint's file extension is `.q. As you might already have guessed,
this README is written in Quaint.
